--    SCHOLARFISCH'S INTRO  .ᐟ   -- 

c + h ( plus kissing and booping ) is always on, feel  free to do so!! ^_^ I don't like being hidden unless it's my friends or my friends' friends or something.. 

Don't be shy to interact with me, I might be a bit weird for the first time n stuff , please do tell me if you get uncomfortable with some stuff that I say ( I make nsfw jokes, lmk if you're uncomf w it... )

pronouns cc in wip ,, But you can call me Ciel, Fisch, John, Augustine or Angus! I'm genderfluid and I mostly use he/him pronouns (Although I don't mind she/her or they/them being used on me!)

I have *some* typing quirks , for example , misspells that i wont correct unless you literally cant understand me ,, I mostly type in all caps
